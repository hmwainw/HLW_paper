This is the data repository for the paper titled "A New Paradigm for High-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal: Intrinsic Radionuclide Properties and Comparative Hazard"

The pre-print is available at: https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/11521/

The datasets used are: 
- pwr_SNF_radionuclides.xlsx: Radionuclide composition over time based on the Serpent simulation, assuming a pressurized water reactor with the parameters of 50 GWd/MTU burnup and 4.5w% initial enrichment.
- RAIS_ChemicalToxicityValues_2025-12-20.xlsx: Cancer slope factors downloaded from https://rais.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/tools/TOX_search?select=chemtox
- Swiss_PA_diffusion_v3.xlsx: Kd, solubility limits from Nagra (2002), Project Opalinus Clay: Safety report. Demonstration of disposal feasibility for spent fuel, vitrified high-level waste and long-lived intermediate-level waste (Entsorgungsnachweis). Nagra Technical Report NTB 02-05, Wettingen, Switzerland.
